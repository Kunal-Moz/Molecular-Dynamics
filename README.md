# Molecular-Dynamics
Pedagogical codes for molecular dynamics

This repository consists of basic codes of Molecular Dynamics which are added as a supplement to the book "Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Elementary Methods" by J.M. Haile and "Computer Simulation of Liquids" by M. P. Allen, D. J. Tildesley. These codes are essentially minor modification to codes given in the books and the github site by Allen and Tildesley - https://github.com/Allen-Tildesley/examples.
